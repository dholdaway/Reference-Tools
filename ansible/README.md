# Learning Tools: Ansible

This folder contains tools, resources, and examples to help with learning how to use Ansible in a variety of environments and for a variety of use cases.

## Contents

**ansible-aws**: This set of files shows how to use Ansible to both provision infrastructure on AWS as well as how to decommission (tear down) that same infrastructure.

**src-dst-list**: This set of files shows how to use complex lists with Ansible's "with_items" construct. This allows you to specify, for example, both source and location for a "copy" task in a single block (when both source and destination vary from item to item).
